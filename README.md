# 🎬 Movie Performance Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

As the company enters the competitive world of movie production, this project analyzes historical box office data to uncover what types of films perform best. The goal is to translate these insights into clear, data-informed recommendations to help our new studio make smart, profitable content decisions.

## 🧠 Business Understanding

Big-name companies are creating original video content and gaining huge market traction. Our company wants to do the same, but wisely.  
We asked: **What kind of movies make the most money?**  
By studying trends in budgets, profits, genres, and release years, we aim to make data-backed decisions on the types of films our new movie studio should invest in.

## 📊 Datasets Used

- **Box Office Mojo**: Provided domestic and international revenue details.  
- **The Numbers**: Gave access to production budgets and overall profitability.

I focused on these two datasets as they offer the most relevant financial insights for our business goal.

## 🔍 Key Questions Explored

- What genres or studios produce the highest ROI?
- Has production spending increased over time?
- Which movies had the highest profits and returns?
- What trends should a new studio consider?

## 📈 Visualizations & Insights

Using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn) and Tableau, I created the following visualizations:

1. **Production Budget vs. Profit**  
   Mid-budget movies often yield higher ROI compared to high-budget ones.

2. **Top 10 Movies by ROI**  
   `Deep Throat` had the highest ROI, with a production budget of **$25,000** and a profit of **$44,975,000**.

3. **Profit Trend Over Time**  
   Movie production and profitability have generally increased from 1915 to 2020.

4. **Studio-wise Profit Distribution**  
   Studios like Warner Bros and Universal show consistent profitability.

5. **Worldwide vs Domestic Gross**  
   International audiences play a major role in boosting total earnings.

## 📌 Project Updates

### 🗓️ August 2025

- **[Merge]** Updated `.gitignore` and merged changes from `main`  
  Merged branch `main` of [https://github.com/Marionmengich/phase2.project](https://github.com/Marionmengich/phase2.project) to include improvements to the `.gitignore` file.  
  This helps prevent unnecessary files (e.g., `__pycache__/`, `.env`, `*.log`) from being tracked and keeps the repository clean.
